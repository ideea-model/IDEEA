## Convenstions
Due to the multi-lingual nature of the IDEEA repository with scripts written in R, Python, Julia, and GAMS, we have adopted the following conventions for naming objects and functions:
- Names of functions and data objects
- Names of the model objects ('technologies', 'regions', 'commodities', etc.)

## IDEEA R-package help
